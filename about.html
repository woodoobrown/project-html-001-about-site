                <h4>Minnesota Timberwolfs</h4>
                <p>
                    In the 2003–04 season, Sprewell became part of the league's highest-scoring trio alongside superstar power forward 
                    Kevin Garnett and point guard Sam Cassell. With a 58–24 record, the Timberwolves qualified for the 2004 playoffs as 
                    the top seed in the Western Conference. They navigated past the Denver Nuggets in five games, and Sacramento Kings 
                    in seven, in the first two rounds of the playoffs. In the Western Conference Finals they met the Los Angeles Lakers, 
                    who defeated them in six games, still the only appearance by the Timberwolves in the conference finals. Sprewell 
                    finished third in team scoring at 16.8 ppg, behind Garnett's 24.2 and Cassell's 19.8.

                    On October 31, 2004, the Minnesota Timberwolves offered Sprewell a three-year, $21 million contract extension, 
                    substantially less than what his then-current contract paid him. Claiming to feel insulted by the offer he publicly 
                    expressed outrage, declaring, "I have a family to feed." He declined the extension and the Timberwolves offered him 
                    nothing more. Having once more drawn the ire of fans and sports media, Sprewell had the worst season of his career 
                    in the final year of his contract. In the summer of 2005, the Denver Nuggets, Cleveland Cavaliers and Houston Rockets 
                    all expressed interest in signing Sprewell, but none ended up signing him.

                    One month into the 2005–06 season and without a contract, Sprewell's agent, Bob Gist, said his client would rather 
                    retire than play for the NBA minimum salary, telling Sports Illustrated, "Latrell doesn't need the money that badly. 
                    To go from being offered $7 million to taking $1 million, that would be a slap in the face." Several days later, Gist 
                    said that Sprewell planned to wait until "teams get desperate" around the trade deadline in February, and then sign 
                    with a contending team - an eventuality that never materialized for him. Gist said that Sprewell would not be 
                    interested in signing for any team's $5 million mid-level exception, calling that amount "a level beneath which 
                    [Sprewell] would not stoop or kneel!"

                    In March 2006, Sprewell was offered contracts by the Dallas Mavericks and San Antonio Spurs, both of whom were 
                    considered at the time to be strong favorites to win the NBA Championship, but Sprewell failed to respond and remained 
                    a free agent as the season came to a close. The Los Angeles Lakers also showed some interest in him at the start of 
                    that season, but nothing ever came of it.

                    Over the course of his career, Sprewell started 868 of the 913 games he played in, averaging 18.8 ppg, 4.2 apg and 
                    4.1 rpg with playoff career averages of 19.7 ppg, 3.4 apg and 4.3 rpg. He was elected to the All-NBA First Team at 
                    the end of his second season, and to the All-NBA Defensive second team that same year.
