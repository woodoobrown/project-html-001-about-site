                    <h4>Before the NBA</h4>
                    <p>
                        After attending Washington High School in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Sprewell played competitively with the Three Rivers 
                Community College Raiders Basketball Team in Poplar Bluff, Missouri from 1988 to 1990, and from 1990 to 1992 with the 
                University of Alabama, where he was a teammate of future NBA players Robert Horry, Jason Caffey and James Robinson.

                        Sprewell was selected 24th overall in the 1992 NBA draft by the Golden State Warriors. Sprewell, nicknamed "Spree", 
                made an immediate impact, starting 69 of the 77 games he played in during his rookie season and averaging 15.4 points 
                per game. His performance would improve over the next few years, leading the team in scoring and playing for the 
                Western Conference All-Star team in 1994, 1995, and 1997, scoring 24.2 ppg in 1996–97, fifth in the league.

                        Sprewell moved into the Knicks' starting lineup for the 1999–2000 season at small forward, and averaged 18.6 points, 
                        helping the Knicks to a 50–32 record good enough for the third seed in the Eastern Conference led by Sprewell, Ewing 
                        and shooting guard Allan Houston. The Knicks navigated past the Toronto Raptors in three hard-fought games and the 
                        Miami Heat in seven even harder-fought games in the first two rounds of the playoffs, en route to the Eastern 
                        Conference Finals against the Indiana Pacers.
